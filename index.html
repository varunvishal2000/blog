    <p>Hello, I am Varun and I am here to document my journey as complete beginner in the world of Computers.</p>
    <p>I don't have any knowledge in the space of web development. I only have a very rudimentary understanding. With that being said I am writing this blog on html and as I go on learning about web dev the blog might become better and more colourful with animations hopefully. :D </p>
