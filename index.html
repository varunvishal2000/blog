      <p> Have failed enough, will swallow my pride and learn from my failures. Not gonna think if I did this earlier, if I did that earlier. I still may, my habits aren't gonna change instantly. </p>
      <p> Consistently gonna do one thing and include that in my spirit </p>
      <p> 20 mins of exercise per day for 1 month. Regularly. This is the only thing I will keep myself accountable for </p>
      <ul><h2> Goals for tomorrow
	  <li> Exercise - To and fro from our complex to the neighbouring complex, 5 push ups, 20 seconds plank, 20 squats.</li>
	  <li> Study - 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. </li>
	  <li> Code - 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> This is embarrasingly low for now but it'll have to do for now. </p>
      <p> See you tomorrow people. It's currently 23:09 right now.</p>
      <p> Today was my birthday, am 24 now. This is my gift for the 25 year old me </p>
